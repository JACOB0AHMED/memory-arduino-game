what did yaakoub added:

1. Introduction of New Sound and LED Effects
First Code: The first code introduces a new intro with a "Spooky Scary Skeletons" melody and a fade in/out effect for the LEDs. This is triggered when the game starts using the playIntroWithFadingLEDs() function.

Second Code: The second code doesn't have this intro. It starts directly with the game logic without any extra sound or LED effects when initializing.

2. Death Note Effect When Player Loses
First Code: If the player makes a mistake, a "Death Note" effect is triggered using the playDeathNote() function. This includes:

Playing a low tone for 1 second

Flashing LEDs in red

Playing a higher tone for dramatic impact

Flashing LEDs several times in red at the end

Second Code: The second code does not have any specific loss-related effects beyond playing a tone when the player fails.

3. LED Changes
First Code: The first code controls three LEDs (blue, yellow, green) with corresponding buttons. The LEDs fade in and out with a smooth transition during the intro.

Second Code: The second code controls four LEDs (blue, yellow, green, red). The LEDs flash when a button is pressed and a sequence is shown in the game.

4. Game Levels and Speed Factor
First Code: The game has a speedfactor that increases as the game progresses, making the LED sequence faster and the game more challenging. The level increases up to n_levels, and the speed of the LEDs adjusts accordingly.

Second Code: Similar to the first code, it has levels that increase as the player progresses. However, it uses a speedfactor and ledtime to control the speed of LED flashes and the time for each button press.

5. Tone Changes for Feedback
First Code: The first code uses specific tones for different LEDs and includes a "fail tone" (a higher tone) when the player loses. It also adds a sound effect at the start and when the game is lost.

Second Code: The second code also uses specific tones for different LEDs and has a "fail tone" when the player loses. However, it doesnâ€™t have the specific tone effects for each step, and the fail tone is just used when the game is lost.

6. Game Logic:
First Code:

Starts with a random sequence of LED presses.

It gradually increases the level by adding more LED presses per round.

When the player fails, the Death Note effect is triggered, and the game restarts.

The game can go up to n_levels, and the difficulty increases as the levels go on.

Second Code:

Similar game logic, but with four buttons and LEDs instead of three.

The game also increases in difficulty with more LEDs and faster speeds as the player progresses through levels.

If the player loses, the failure is handled by flashing all LEDs and playing a fail tone, and then restarting the game.

Key Differences:
The "Death Note" effect in the first code adds an interesting dramatic failure sequence that the second code lacks.

The LED count is increased in the second code (4 LEDs/buttons instead of 3).

The speed adjustment mechanism is similar in both, but the first code includes fading effects for LEDs during the intro phase, which the second code doesn't have.
